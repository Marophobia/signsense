# Test fixtures

Place a sample ASL hand image here as `sample_asl_frame.jpg` to run:

```bash
python scripts/test_roboflow_inference.py
```

without arguments. You can also pass any image path:

```bash
python scripts/test_roboflow_inference.py path/to/any/image.jpg
```

Sample images are available from [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com) (search for "ASL hand gesture").
